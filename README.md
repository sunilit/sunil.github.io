### ADConv-Net: Advanced Deep Convolution Neural Network for COVID-19 Diagnostics Using Chest X-Ray and CT Images
[Publication](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-025-03923-4)

Developed objective strategy for discovering X-ray and CT based image on ADConv-Net Framework using DL **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better classification of the underlying image by identifying COVID-19, Normal, Bacterial Pneumonia and Viral Pnuemonia. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key diseases and possibly discovering new indices of lung activity.

### Role of Genomics in Smart Era and Its Application in COVID‐19
[Publication](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781394213726.ch4)

The discovery of the genetic roots of human diseases and other complex traits is one of the main goals of genomics, which may lead to the development of treatments and medications. By comparing the genomes of DNA sequencing disorders, researchers can uncover the genes responsible for desirable characteristics such as improved genetics, disease resistance, and better efficiency. This information is essential to develop populations of organisms better adaptable to evolving biological conditions. This chapter provides an overview of genomics, including its background, key attributes, and various types and application areas.
