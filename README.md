## Projects
### ADConv-Net: Advanced Deep Convolution Neural Network for COVID-19 Diagnostics Using Chest X-Ray and CT Images
[Publication](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42979-025-03923-4)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### EffiCOVID-net: A highly efficient convolutional neural network for COVID-19 diagnosis using chest X-ray imaging
[Publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202325001033?via%3Dihub)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
